<!--origin story

            <h2>What is Svara's Story?</h2>
            <p>
              Svara was founded from Stacie and Teju’s shared passion for dance and helping children. Trained in Indian Classical and Bollywood styles, they hope to share the joy, discipline, and culture of dance with their community. Stacie’s experience tutoring with a nonprofit and teaching at her academy deepened her belief in the power of encouragement and patience. Teju, a Kathak dancer for nearly a decade and a member of her school’s varsity team, sees dance as a language that connects people and culture. Their shared love for the art form inspired them to create a nonprofit dedicated to making a difference for children in Portland. And thus, Svara was born.
