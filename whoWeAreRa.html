            <h2>What is Svara's Story?</h2>
            <p>
               Svara was founded from Pooja and Teju’s shared passion for dance and helping children. With years of training in Indian Classical and Bollywood styles, they are excited to share the joy, discipline, and culture of dance with their community. Pooja’s dedication to children grew through tutoring with a nonprofit and teaching dance at her academy, where she saw the impact of encouragement and patience. These experiences led to the idea of their very own non-profit organization to make a tangible difference in the lives of children in the Portland Community. And thus, Svara was born.
